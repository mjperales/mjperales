# Hi, I'm Mayra üëãüèΩ

I am a Senior Software Engineer who is passionate about building user-friendly, accessible web applications. Some technologies I enjoy working with are React (JavaScript, SCSS, HTML) and Node. I enjoy reading, walking my lovely dog, and chasing my sons around.  

Currently, I work at [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) where I help build tools to help the newsroom. We publish all our applications through AWS using Cloudformation templates and Serverless Framework. Occasionally, I help with internship resumes and interviews.

  <summary>Slackbot</summary>
Built a Slackbot implementation to fetch stories from an API, compare and add details into a Google Spreadsheet. We used a AWS State Machine with step functions that runs every 30 minutes. The end result was to send Slack messages with a summary of stories that meet certain criteria.
