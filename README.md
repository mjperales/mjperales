### 🚀 Featured Projects

- **Haystacker**  
  An AI-powered tool for analyzing images and video to support newsroom investigations. I built the frontend using React and TypeScript as part of a weeklong team effort during The Post Hackathon.  
  Awarded 3rd place and adopted company-wide for investigative workflows.

- **[From the Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/06/30/reusable-cups-concerts-stadiums/)**  
  A newsroom tool that uses an LLM and Kafka pipeline to detect living sources in newly published articles and invite them to respond. I built the frontend using Next.js and TypeScript to display responses through accessible UI components like tooltips and drawers.  
  Delivered under a 3-week CTO-sponsored deadline as part of a real-time engagement initiative.

- **[2024 U.S. Election Dashboard](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/results/2024/11/05/election-dashboard/)**  
  A flagship data dashboard tracking real-time election results, viewed over 300K times and ranked in the top 20 stories during election week. I contributed key frontend components and collaborated across teams to ensure performance and accessibility at scale.

- **Slackbot Alert System (Internal)**  
  An internal alerting tool that notifies the newsroom when print-marked articles include Datawrapper elements. I led development of the AWS-powered workflow using Step Functions, Lambda, and the Slack API to scan articles every 30 minutes and deliver formatted Slack messages.  
  Streamlined print-readiness checks and improved editorial coordination across teams.

- **[On the Record](https://www.washingtonpost.com/games/news-quiz/)**  
  An interactive quiz application built with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL to support editorial storytelling. I led schema design, frontend development, and admin tooling.  
  This high-impact project contributed to my promotion to Senior Software Engineer.
